# ncSender ‚Äî Simple, Fast G‚ÄëCode Sender for GrblHAL

ncSender is a lightweight, cross‚Äëplatform CNC controller with a clean UI and built‚Äëin 3D toolpath preview. It connects to GrblHAL controllers over USB serial or Ethernet and can run either as a desktop app (Electron) or as a small local server you access from any browser on your network.

## ‚ú® Why ncSender
- Cross‚Äëplatform desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi).
- USB serial and Ethernet (telnet‚Äëstyle) connectivity.
- Live console with command history and real‚Äëtime GrblHAL controls (hold, resume, soft reset).
- 3D toolpath preview with progress tracking.
- Workspace selection (G54‚ÄìG59) and homing prompts.
- Metric and imperial units support with automatic conversion.
- Firmware settings browser for GrblHAL (read/submit, import/export).
- Safe job controls: pause before stop, resume.
- Dead-man switch safety feature for jogging operations.
- Headless mode: run just the server and use it from a browser.
- UI theme support (light/dark) and configurable accent/gradient colors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

- **Limit Switches Required**: Machines without physical limit switches are not yet supported, as some functionality relies on machine coordinate movement.
- **GRBL Compatibility**: Although ncSender may work with GRBL, it has not been thoroughly tested. Use with caution.
- **Hardware Tested**: ncSender has only been tested with the Sienci SLEB-EXT board (included with AltMill CNC) running grblHAL or sienciHAL firmware.

## üì¶ Install

Download a release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/siganberg/ncSender/releases) for your OS:

- **macOS**: open the `.dmg`, drag ncSender to Applications. If Gatekeeper warns about an unknown developer, right‚Äëclick the app, choose Open, then Open again.
- **Windows**: run the `.exe` and follow the prompts (you may see a SmartScreen warning for an unsigned app).
- **Linux**: use the `.AppImage` or `.deb` (depending on your distro). Mark the AppImage as executable.
- **Raspberry Pi**: use the ARM64 `.deb` or `.AppImage` package.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1) Connect your controller
- USB: plug your controller via USB. Default baud is 115200.
- Ethernet: ensure you know the controller's IP and port (default GrblHAL telnet‚Äëstyle ports are often 23 or device‚Äëspecific).

2) Launch ncSender
- On first launch, a setup dialog guides you to choose USB or Ethernet, pick the port, and confirm baud/IP/port. Save to connect.

3) Load a G‚Äëcode file
- Use the Visualizer panel to upload or load a file. You‚Äôll see a 3D preview, line count, and file name.

4) Prepare the machine
- Home (if required), set work offsets, and verify workspace (G54‚ÄìG59) from the toolbar.

5) Run the job
- Click Run. The status shows Running with progress tracking. Use Pause/Resume as needed. Stop safely pauses briefly before soft‚Äëreset to reduce marks.

Theme and colors
- Toggle light/dark from the toolbar sun icon.
- Change accent/gradient colors under Settings ‚Üí Application Settings.

## üñ•Ô∏è Using Headless Mode (advanced)
Run the embedded server without the Electron window and access ncSender from any browser on your network.

- **macOS**: `/Applications/ncSender.app/Contents/MacOS/ncSender --headless`
- **Windows**: `"C:\\Program Files\\ncSender\\ncSender.exe" --headless`
- **Linux/Raspberry Pi (AppImage)**: `./ncSender-*.AppImage --headless` or `ncSender --headless` if installed in PATH

Then open `http://<this-computer-ip>:8090` in a browser (replace with your machine's LAN IP). The port is configurable in Settings (Remote Control Port) and requires an app restart to take effect.

## üíæ Data & Settings
ncSender stores its data per‚Äëplatform:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/ncSender/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/ncSender/`
- **Linux / Raspberry Pi**: `~/.config/ncSender/`

These folders are created automatically and contain G‚Äëcode files and settings. Files persist across updates and are easy to back up.

## üîß Tips & Troubleshooting
- Can't find the USB port
  - Unplug/replug the device and reopen Settings. On Windows you may need the correct USB‚Äëserial driver. On macOS, avoid Bluetooth ports.
- Connection fails
  - Confirm baud rate (115200 is common). For Ethernet, confirm the IP/port and network reachability (firewall). Try power‚Äëcycling the controller.
- "Homing Required"
  - Home the machine first (per your controller/firmware) to clear the prompt.
- Alarm/Locked
  - Use "Unlock" or send `$X` from the console if you understand the risks. Review the last alarm code for details.
- Nothing moves when sending a job
  - Ensure the machine is Idle (not Alarm/Hold), correct workspace selected, and your file units/modes match the machine (G20/G21, G90/G91, etc.).
- Machine behaving unexpectedly
  - Try a soft reset by clicking the center button in the jog controls or send `Ctrl+X` from the console. This clears the command buffer and resets the controller state.

## üîí Privacy
Everything runs locally. ncSender does not send your files or machine data to remote servers.

## üí¨ Need Help?
This is a personal, for‚Äëfun project that I‚Äôm actively iterating on. I‚Äôm not providing support at the moment, and I‚Äôm not accepting new issue submissions yet. Once things are more stable, I may start accepting GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
